Hadoop
===

This is a quick guide on getting your feet wet with Hadoop. It'll teach you how to setup a single-node hadoop cluster, run jobs in Java/Python and lastly, explore the results.

#### Getting Hadoop

The easiest way to try out Hadoop locally as a developer is by running a preconfigured-VM.

1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) for your Operating System.
2. For the VM, we'll be using Cloudera's VM that they made available for Udacity. Unlike the official Cloudera Hadoop distribution (CHD) this is a more stripped down version (1.7 GB). Download the file from [here](http://content.udacity-data.com/courses/ud617/Cloudera-Udacity-Training-VM-4.1.1.c.zip) and unzip it. If you are on a Windows machine you will likely need to use WinRAR to open this .zip file because other methods fail to open the unzipped file (which exceeds the maximum specified 4GB for a .zip file).
3. Open Virtualbox and click on "New".
4. Give a name "Hadoop", Type as "Linux" and Version as "Ubuntu (64-bit)"
5. Drag the slider to select a memory of 2048 MB
6. In the hard disk section, click the radio button "Use an existing virtual hard disk file", browse to your download directory and select the `Cloudera-Training-VM-4.1.1.c.vmdk` file.
7. Now you should see a "hadoop" machine in the sidebar. Select it and click on Settings.
8. Choose network from the top panel, and change the "Attached to" to Bridged Adapter.
9. You can now select the machine, and click on "Start".
10. Your machine will now boot up.

#### Running Jobs

Before we start running MapReduce jobs, we first need to get the code. When the VM first starts, the terminal should already be open. Get started by cloning this repository.
#### Notice
For anyone unable to clone the git repository, for the security encoding reasons:           
run this command in the terminal first:             
```
sudo yum install ca-certificates
```
```
$ cd ~/Desktop
$ git clone https://github.com/prakhar1989/csds-material
$ cd csds-material
```

Linux and Mac users can also SSH into the machine by running `ssh training@ip-address` and entering the password - `training`. To get the IP address of the machine, just run `ifconfig` and taking note of the inet addr.

![ip](http://i.imgur.com/VUMJkVy.png)

The `csds-material` directory has an input folder which describes the input on which we'll running our MapReduce jobs. To view the contents, just type the following -

```
$ cat input/*
Hello World Bye World
Hello Hadoop Goodbye Hadoop
```

The job that we're going to run is the canonical wordcount example - it counts the number of words in a file (set of files).

#### HDFS
HDFS or Hadoop FileSystem is the filesystem where Hadoop expects the input files to be. When a job completes, HDFS is also where the final result will be placed by Hadoop. So the first thing we need to do, is to move our input files into HDFS. 
### Notice
make sure you are in the csds file, where has "input" file.           
```
$ hadoop fs -ls /user/
drwxr-xr-x   - hue      supergroup          0 2013-09-05 20:08 /user/hive
drwxr-xr-x   - hue      hue                 0 2013-09-10 10:37 /user/hue
drwxr-xr-x   - training supergroup          0 2013-10-04 18:58 /user/training

$ hadoop fs -mkdir /user/csds
$ hadoop fs -copyFromLocal input /user/csds/
$ hadoop fs -ls /user/csds/input
Found 2 items
-rw-r--r--   1 training supergroup         22 2016-01-25 23:06 /user/csds/input/file1
-rw-r--r--   1 training supergroup         28 2016-01-25 23:06 /user/csds/input/file2
```

Great! Now that we have our data residing in HDFS, lets run our mapreduce job!


##### Java

To run the java job, we'll first create a jar and then tell `hadoop` to run it.

```
$ cd java-example
$ export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=${JAVA_HOME}/lib/tools.jar
$ hadoop com.sun.tools.javac.Main WordCount.java
$ jar cf wc.jar WordCount*.class
```
When this is done, we'll have a `wc.jar` in our directory which we'll use to run a MapReduce job. 

```
$ hadoop jar wc.jar WordCount /user/csds/input /user/csds/output

Our job has now run! To see the output, we can view the `/user/csds/output/` directory.

```

Awesome! Our hadoop job ran correctly.

##### Python

Hadoop, by default, only supports Java for writing MR jobs. However, its [streaming](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/streaming.html) API allows us to provide any shell executable program to be the mapper and the reducer. The `python-example` folder has the corresponding code for `mapper` and `reducer`.

Since our `input` folder already exists in HDFS, we will not need to create the folder again. Let's directly run the MR job

```
$ cd python-example
$ hs mapper.py reducer.py /user/csds/input/* /user/csds/outputpy

##### Tracking jobs
Hadoop provides a simple interface to track the status of MR jobs. To view it, you first need to get the VM ip using `ifconfig`. Then note the `inet addr` address. Finally, open `http://ip:50030/jobtracker.jsp` on your local machine. Alternatively, you can also open Firefox in the VM and browse to `http://localhost:50030/jobtracker.jsp` to view the jobs.

### AWS EMR

In this section, we'll see how we can use [AWS Elastic Mapreduce](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/) (EMR) to run our MapReduce job. To follow along, make sure you have a functioning AWS account.

AWS EMR reads and writes data to [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) so the first step is to upload our application code and input to S3. Head over to the [console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1), create a new bucket (with a unique bucket name) and upload `python-example/mapper.py`, `python-example/reducer.py` and `aws_emr/aws.txt`.

We can now begin configuring our MR job. Head over to the [EMR console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/home?region=us-east-1) and click on **Create Cluster**. See the screen below for the options to configure -

![img](http://i.imgur.com/NAbeCpj.png)

AWS will then go ahead and follow that up with the cluster creation screen -

![img](http://i.imgur.com/eF4pPVK.png)

The next step is to add a MR step. Click on **Add Step** and fill in the details as shown below. Be sure to change these paths for your S3 bucket.
### Notice
Make sure the output path is "output", rename or build a new file may cause your step failed.               

![img](http://i.imgur.com/AuXphLo.png)

When done, the status of the cluster will change from *Waiting* to *Running*. After a few minutes, your job should be complete. This is indicated by the status of the cluster again going back to *Waiting*. You can now head over to the S3 bucket and see the output being generated.

![img](http://i.imgur.com/U2XYgJr.png)

And that's it! This is how your run MR jobs on AWS EMR!

Hive
====

This section teaches you how to try out [Hive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hive) on the VM. The Hive data warehouse facilitates querying and managing large datasets residing in distributed storage. Hive provides a mechanism to project structure onto this data and query the data using a SQL-like language called HiveQL. At the same time this language also allows traditional map/reduce programmers to plug in their custom mappers and reducers when it is inconvenient or inefficient to express this logic in HiveQL.

In this section, we'll see how to use Hive to query a dataset of Shopping Mall purchases. The dataset is located in the `hive/purchases.txt`. Hive is already installed and setup on your VM, so getting started is just a command away. Type the following in the terminal -

```
$ hive
Logging initialized using configuration in file:/etc/hive/conf.dist/hive-log4j.properties
Hive history file=/tmp/training/hive_job_log_training_201602010336_645327107.txt
hive> 
```

Let's use the `SHOW TABLES` command to see if any tables exist. Interacting with Hive is exactly like any relational database - so if you've worked with MySQL or PostgreSQL before you'll feel right at home.
```
hive> SHOW TABLES;
OK
Time taken: 2.028 seconds
```
Since no tables exist, we see a blank list. Now let's go ahead and create a table. 

```
hive> CREATE TABLE test_tables;
FAILED: SemanticException [Error 10043]: Either list of columns or a custom serializer should be specified

hive> CREATE TABLE test_tables (some_text STRING);
OK
Time taken: 0.713 seconds

hive> SHOW TABLES;
OK
test_tables
Time taken: 0.053 seconds

hive> select * from test_tables;
OK
Time taken: 0.161 seconds
```

Press `Ctrl-D` to exit from the Hive console. So we created the `test_tables` above, but the first command failed because we didn't provide any schema. Every table that you wish to create must have a schema. In the subsequent command, we provide a dummy column name - `some_text` of the `STRING` type to make the command succeed. Once the table is created, `SHOW TABLES` correctly lists our table. However, since our table has no data, the `select` query returns a blank list.

Now we know how to create a table in Hive, we'll create a table and add real data. But before we do that, let us inspect the data that we're going to put in. This will be required for coming up with a schema for our database.

```
$ head purchases.txt
2012-07-20 09:59:00,Corpus Christi,CDs,327.91,Cash
2012-03-11 17:29:00,Durham,Books,115.09,Discover
2012-07-31 11:43:00,Rochester,Toys,332.07,MasterCard

2012-07-03 11:05:00,Virginia Beach,Women's Clothing,23.47,Cash
```

We can see above that our data has 5 columns, each separated by a comma. The first column is a timestamp indicating the time and date of the sale. The second column indicates the store location where the sale occured, followed by the category of the product. The last two columns indicate the price and the mode of payment associated with the sale respectively.

Let's log into `hive` and load this data into HDFS. We'll start by first creating a new table.

```
hive> CREATE TABLE purchases (
  `sales_date` TIMESTAMP,
  `store_location` STRING,
  `category` STRING,
  `price` FLOAT,
  `card` STRING 
) row format delimited fields terminated by ',' stored as textfile;
OK
Time taken: 0.177 seconds
```
In the above command, we create a new table called `purchases` with the appropriate schema shown above. The `row format ...` command tells Hive that we'll be loading in data from a [csv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file eventually. The next step is to move our data into HDFS so that we can import it in Hive. Exit from hive and run the following command from the `csds-material` directory.

```
$ hadoop fs -copyFromLocal hive/purchases.txt /user/csds/input
$ hadoop fs -ls /user/csds/input
Found 1 items
-rw-r--r--   1 training supergroup      53755 2016-02-01 04:29 /user/csds/input/purchases.txt
```
Now we have everything in place to load data in Hive. Log back into the `hive` console and run the following -
```
hive> LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/csds/input/purchases.txt' INTO TABLE purchases;
Loading data to table default.purchases
OK
Time taken: 2.436 seconds
```
Great our data is now loaded. Now let's explore the data 
```
hive> show tables;
OK
purchases
test_tables
Time taken: 0.133 seconds

hive> select * from purchases limit 10;
OK

```
In this last query, we ran a simple query to calculate the total price of all the products that were paid in cash. We can see that our query got mapped to MapReduce tasks and got run by Hadoop. Finally at the end, we see the answer to our query - $55199 and also the total time taken.

So this is how you can use Hive and the power of SQL to analyse your big data that is already stored on an HDFS cluster. For more practice, try running your own queries and see what you can uncover. If you're feeling adventurous, try to formuate the queries for answering the questions below -

1. What is the average price of the products that were purchased via Mastercard?
2. Which date recorded the highest total sales?
3. What is the minimum value of a product under the Computers category?
4. How many distinct categories of products are there?
5. Which store location had the lowest total sales?

If you need help with HiveQL, [this](https://docs.treasuredata.com/articles/hive) documentation should be useful.
